# Introduction:

The project focuses on using artificial intelligence (AI) and CNNs to improve the accuracy of brain tumor detection. The study involves developing and analyzing various CNN models, including pre-trained models like VGG16, EfficientNetV2B3, and custom models. The aim is to achieve the highest possible accuracy in detecting and classifying different types of brain tumors.

# Objectives:

### The project sets out several specific objectives:
- Collecting and preparing a suitable MRI dataset.
- Designing and developing various CNN models.
- Training and tuning the models.
- Evaluating and comparing the models.
- Analyzing results to determine the feasibility of using AI for brain tumor detection.
Problem Definition:

The document defines the problem of detecting and classifying brain tumors as crucial due to the life-threatening nature of these tumors. The project aims to improve early and accurate detection, which can lead to better patient outcomes.

# Scope:

The scope is limited to the development and evaluation of CNN models for brain tumor detection using MRI images. The project utilizes Python and machine learning libraries like TensorFlow and Keras, and a dataset from Kaggle.

# Methods:

### Detailed explanation of the methods, tools, and technologies used:
- Python and various libraries (NumPy, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, Keras, etc.) are employed for model development.
- The dataset is pre-processed and split into training, validation, and testing sets.
- Several CNN models (VGG16, ENV2B0, ResNet50, and a Custom Sequential Model) are tested and evaluated.

# Data Source:

### The dataset used for training and testing is obtained from Kaggle, consisting of MRI images categorized into four classes: Non-tumor, Glioma, Meningioma, and Pituitary.

# Ethical Considerations:

The project discusses the ethical implications of AI, particularly the carbon footprint associated with training AI models. Despite the environmental concerns, the project justifies the use of AI for its potential to improve medical outcomes, aligning with the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of ensuring healthy lives.

# Results and Analysis:

The results section compares the performance of the different models, with VGG16 achieving the best accuracy. A confusion matrix and classification report are provided for the best model.
